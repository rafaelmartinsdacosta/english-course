# Language at work | Past simple

### 1. Look at the list of inventions below. Which ones are the most important to you today? Why?
- Twitter
- Mobile phone
- World Wide Web
- Smart cards

For me, the most important invention is the World Wide Web because with that we start to interact with other people around the world with great velocity.

With that facility, we start to consume all types of documents, videos, and photos and began creating some communities, improving some ideas, and improving all types of products and services we have in our current world, like streaming platforms, e-commerce, and social networks and new professions too.

Another important aspect of WWW was the facility to connect with other people in any location, turn communication more natural independently of the distance.

## 2 - Try to match the inventions in 1 to their inventors and the year you think they were invented.

- Twitter
    - Jack Dorsey
        - 2006
- Mobile phone
    - Martin Cooper
        - 1973
- World Wide Web
    - Tim Berners-Lee
        - 1991
- Smart cards
    - Roland Moreno
        - 1974

## 3 - Listen to the beginning of radio programme about inventors and check your answers.
