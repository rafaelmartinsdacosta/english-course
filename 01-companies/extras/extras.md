  - A prague/pest is consuming all plants in the earth and the one out to this problem is search other place to mantain the life (as a human life) existing in the universe. With two possibilities, that can occurr in paralell, where one of them is create a mega starship to leave the Earth and colonize a new planet with human race, and other way is send a group of astronauts to search for a habitable planet with capacity to supporty a human life and with resources to start a colonization.
- **Local**
  - The history happens in two distinct places and in parallel times. The first place is Earth and other place is a space. In the earth we have a group of engineer and mathematicians trying to resolve a gravitation formula to resolve a problem to launch a big starship and in space with last group of astronauts undestarding the data sended by another group to decidee the best possibility to human race (in this case on begining of the movie is explained about other group of 12 astronauts sended to 12 planets to collect data, without expectation to return to the Earth) 
- **Time** 
  - The movie happens in the future (unspecified time)
- **Director** 
  - Christopher Nolan.
- **Actors and Actresses**
  - Matthew McConaughey -> Cooper
  - Anne Hathaway -> Amelia Brand (professor's daughther)

  - Jessica Chastain -> Murphy Cooper daugther (adult)
  - TimothÃ©e Chalamet -> Son of Cooper (child)
  - Casey Affleck -> Son of Cooper (adult)
  - Michael Caine -> Professor (math)
  - Matt Damon -> Dr. Mann
  - David Oyelowo -> David (stayed at the starship)
- **Sound track**
  - [Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw)
- **Development**
  - In space the stronaut collect and verify data about the planets, data sended by first group, every planets are accesible by a black hole, wich one appear ten years ago nearly from Earth, and by this black is possible to access another galaxy to explore the twelve planets searched by first group, no one knows how to the black hole appers them. During the exploration the astronauts identify a problem, because the gravity of the black hole on center of that new galaxy is possible the astronaut visit feels planets, because the closer to the center of the galaxy we have a time passing slower off-center and to the its not possible no visit all planets, if they do that is possible the humans on Earth has no more food e no more possibilties to be travel to the new habitable planet.
  - In this moment they have three possible planets to visit, The Miller's Planet, Dr Mann planet and the Edmunds planet.
  - Starting with Miller's planet they discovery a water for every where and in this planet the starship was hited by a gigant wave and the passengers are not alive.
  - They stayed feel hours in the planet but to David was passed 23 years.
  - After this time the team go to the Dr Mann's planet because the good data sended from them, but all data was created by Dr. Mann with a intention to the rescued and Dr. Mann try to kill Cooper to run away and go back to the Earth.
  - Dr mann explode the starship and Cooper recovery the space center.
  - The last chance is go to the Dr Edmunds planet, and Cooper send Amelia Brand to the last planet and try to back to the Earth to see Murphy.
  - Cooper try to use the gravity of Gargantua as a fuel to the starship and in this moment he fall in a place with diferent space time, with a new concept like a fifth dimension.
  - In this place is possible to see past, present and future, is possible to iteract with gravity in another time and with that property he send a message in the past to Murphy, help her to discover the formula to transport the people of Earth to the space and giving them a chance to survive.
- **Conclusion**
  - It's amazing film, we have a lot of details about the relativity, and how it is affected by planet and how the time is related to this
- **Youtube**
