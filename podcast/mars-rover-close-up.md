# Mars rover close up
A show where we eavesdrop on the wild conversations we have at Nat Geo, and follow them to the edges of our big, weird, beautiful world.

## Notes

- BELL: **Yeah, the forecast** for tomorrow is **just like the forecast for yesterday in general**, and like the **forecast has been every day for billions of years**: No chance of rain. Tonight's temperature is going to dip down to maybe minus a hundred degrees Celsius—minus two hundred Fahrenheit. But tomorrow it's going to be a balmy, maybe plus-three Celsius.
- [Sounds](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/sounds/?playlist=mars&item=mars-helicopter-flying&type=mars) from Mars
  - Those crunchy noises? They are the sounds recorded by a microphone aboard Perseverance, picking up the whir of the rover’s thermal system, as it hurtles through deep space at a speed of more than 50,000 miles per hour.
- DRAKE: There was one really **influential map that was produced in 1877** by Giovanni Schiaparelli, and the reason why they were doing it at that time was because Mars was at opposition, meaning that it's directly opposite the sun in Earth's sky. So it's its brightest and it's at its closest point in the two planets’ orbits and so they could see it the best.
- Some rover sended to Mars
  - Spirit, 
  - Opportunity, 
  - and Curiosity
- Drake: There was the work of Percival Lowell, who was mapping it and was **absolutely convinced** that he was seeing this **planet-spanning network of irrigation canals** that were constructed by intelligent Martians. And those stories really took off.
- So **photography of Mars actually happened pretty early on**, before **1910**. And that was essentially what undid Lowell's theories, because people could see that the image of Mars taken through **telescopes didn't match the maps**.
- It was **1996**, and that **discovery** of **microscopic** **fossilized bacteria found** in a meteorite made its way into a major scientific paper, and then into headlines, and into a speech by then **President Bill Clinton**.
- HERNANDEZ: So our prime mission is one year on Mars, which is roughly two Earth years. And what's really cool in this concept of being a Martian for the first few months we'll actually be on this thing called Mars time.
- BELL: It's an artistic choice almost on how to portray these colors. There are versions of these kinds of panoramas in more natural Mars color, and the sky generally is pink. It's been described as pink. It's been described as salmon. It's been described as butterscotch. And it changes. It changes with time of day. It changes from day to day, as dust storms come and go, just like Earth's sky. On Mars there's always dust in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is so thin that if there were no dust, the sky would be black, like on the moon.
- The odds are stacked against us with that kind of thing on Mars. However, Mars doesn't care about the odds. Nature doesn't care about the odds. Nature freaks us out and surprises us all the time.
- **Perseverance** is a large, six-wheeled rover **equipped with a suite of sophisticated instruments**. Its target is **Jezero Crater**, site of an ancient river delta, and a likely location for ancient life-forms to have thrived. Once on the surface, **Perseverance will study Martian climate and weather, test technologies that could help humans survive on Mars**, and collect samples from dozens of rocks that will eventually be brought to Earth. Among its goals is helping to determine whether Mars was—or is—inhabited, **making it a true life-finding Mars mission**.
- Mars
  - Mars is the second small planet in the solar system
  - The diameter is nearly of the width of Africa
  - In fact, its entire surface area is similar to that of all of Earth's continents combined
  - Core is made of:
    - Iron
    - Nickel
    - Sulfur
    - create a magnetic field that protect the planet
  - Water still exists today, mostly as polar ice caps
  - Temperature is minus (0, 20,60 - 142)C during the night
